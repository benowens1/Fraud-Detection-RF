# Fraud-Detection-RF
This project investigates the use of Random Forest for detecting credit card fraud on a highly imbalanced dataset. The project applies SMOTE to balance the dataset and performs hyper-parameter tuning to optimise model performance. A Logistic Regression model is used as a baseline for comparison.

### Tools & Methods
Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn
Techniques:
	•	Random Forest Classifier
	•	SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
	•	Hyper-parameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV
	•	Performance Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC
